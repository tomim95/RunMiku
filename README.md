#Run Miku

About the Game:
Run Miku is a fast-paced 2D game I created in a week as a birthday gift for my partner. In a way, this project was my personal game jam, pushing me to design, code, and create all assets within a short timeframe.
In this chaotic chase, you must catch Hatsune Miku before the other fans do! But be careful—you're not the only one after her.

Gameplay Features:
  -  Crowds of fans also chasing Miku. If they push you, you lose all collected speed boosts.
  -  Police officers protecting Miku. If they catch you, you get arrested, and the game ends.
  -  Floating musical notes that Miku drops. Collect them to increase your movement speed.
  -  "EESTÄ POIS" skill – Activate my partner's powerful voice to momentarily stun fans and police while getting a small speed boost. The skill has a cooldown.
  -  Hand-drawn pixel art – Every visual element was created from scratch.
  -  Diverse sound effects – Sourced from various places to enhance immersion.

How to Play:
  -  Move around the map and chase Miku.
  -  Avoid the police—getting caught means game over.
  -  Collect floating musical notes to boost your speed.
  -  Stay away from other fans, or they'll push you and reset your speed.
  -  Use the "EESTÄ POIS" skill strategically to stun enemies and gain an advantage.
  -  Catch Miku to win!

Why This Project?
This game was a fun challenge and a great opportunity to improve my skills in game design, pixel art, sound integration, and fast-paced prototyping. While it started as a personal project, I hope others find it entertaining too!
